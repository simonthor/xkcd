# xkcd
Generating xkcd comics using Python with machine learning.

The goal of this project is for me to learn more about machine learning and neural networks, language processing, image processing etc., while also expressing my love for [xkcd](https://xkcd.com)!

## Status
I have just started the project.

## Required packages
See [environment.yml](environment.yml). 
Since the project is still in its early stages, this list will likely change. 

## Conda environemnt
If you use conda (which I recommend but is not required), go to your project directory and run
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml --prefix ./env
conda activate ./env
```
## Files
The files in [ml_intro/](ml_intro) are not written by me, but copied from Google and only used for learning purposes.
